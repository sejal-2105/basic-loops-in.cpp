Aim: To study and implement basic loops in C++.

Tools: C++ IDE/ visual studio code.

Theory: Operators can be of different types-

Arithmetic Operators- These help carry out different mathematical operations like adding numbers, subtraction , multiplication, division ,etc without the need of math libraries.
Logical Operators - These perform logical functions like AND(&&),OR(||),NOT(!).
Relational Operators- These operators carry out comparision between two different quantities. Like less than, greater than, equal to , etc.
Bitwise Operators
Loops: Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. They help avoid writing repetitive code. ðŸ”¹ 1. for Loop- Used when the number of iterations is known. Initialization (int i = 0) Condition (i < 5) Update (i++)

Conclusion : With the help of these codes we laernt to implement basic if-else and if-elseif-else loops, using the LOGICAL OPERATOR 'AND (&&)' and RELATIONAL OPERATOR '>', '<', '='.
